    <h1>Hi! You are probably lost.</h1>

    <p>
        Not sure how you got here, but this is a site served via the gopher protocol, and you requested a file over HTTP. Check out <a href="http://gopher.floodgap.com/overbite/">The Overbite Project</a> for more information about gopherspace, or just head over to the <a href="https://richabdill.com">HTTP version of my site</a>, which is probably what you were looking for in the first place. Have a lovely day.
